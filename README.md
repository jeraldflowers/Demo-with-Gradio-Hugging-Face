# Demo-with-Gradio-Hugging-Face
In this repository we collect the code used in building Demos for our Hugging Face platform. Where we carried out a project of voice recognition and transformation to text with Gradio. Resulting in an interface and a simple but very useful design for the consumption of our model.
